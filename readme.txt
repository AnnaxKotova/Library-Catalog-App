Task: Build a Library Catalog App

Description:

Imagine you are tasked with building a library catalog app for a small library. The app should allow librarians to manage books, patrons to borrow and return books, and provide search functionality for finding books in the library.

Requirements:

Book Management:

Create an object to represent a book. Each book should have properties like title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.
Create an array to store books in the library.
Patron Management:

Create an object to represent a library patron. Each patron should have properties like name, library card number, and a list of borrowed books.
Create an array to store library patrons.
Book Checkout:

Implement a function that allows patrons to check out a book. It should update the book's availability status and add the book to the patron's list of borrowed books.
Ensure that a book cannot be checked out if it's already checked out by another patron.
Book Return:

Implement a function that allows patrons to return a book. It should update the book's availability status and remove the book from the patron's list of borrowed books.
Search Functionality:

Implement a search feature that allows users to search for books by title, author, or genre and display a list of matching books.
Display Functions:

Implement functions to display a list of all books in the library, a list of all patrons, and a list of books checked out by a specific patron.
User Interface (Optional):

Create a simple user interface (HTML/CSS) for interacting with the library catalog.
Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and display information.
Notes:

You can structure your app as a set of functions and objects that perform these tasks.
You can use the console for displaying information if you don't want to build a graphical user interface.
You can add more features or complexity as you see fit.
This task involves creating objects, managing their properties and interactions, and implementing various functions. It's a great way to practice working with objects, arrays, and functions in JavaScript while building a useful mini app.
